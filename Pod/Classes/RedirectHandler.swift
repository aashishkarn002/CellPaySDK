    ///   - task:       The `URLSessionTask` whose request resulted in a redirect.
    ///   - request:    The `URLRequest` to the new location specified by the redirect response.
    ///   - response:   The `HTTPURLResponse` containing the server's response to the original request.
    ///   - completion: The closure to execute containing the new `URLRequest`, a modified `URLRequest`, or `nil`.
